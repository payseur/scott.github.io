# About

This is a *sample* book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports; for example, a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

## Usage

Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.

Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`.

The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.

## Render book

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

1.  Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

2.  Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

Or build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

```{r chunk-label, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap = 'A figure caption.'}
library(lubridate)
library(rvest)
library(readr)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

tlt_url = 'https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239454/ishares-20-year-treasury-bond-etf'
shy_url = 'https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239452/ishares-13-year-treasury-bond-etf'
#agg_url = 'https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239458/ishares-core-total-us-bond-market-etf'

base_url = 'https://www.ishares.com'
url_data = tlt_url
url_data = shy_url
#url_data = agg_url


css_selector <- "#holdings > div.holdings.fund-component-data-export > a.icon-xls-export"
css_link <- url_data %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_elements(css = css_selector) %>% 
  html_attr('href') 

url_data_csv <- paste0(base_url, css_link)

br_csv <- read_csv(url_data_csv, skip = 0)
holdings_date <- br_csv[1,1] %>%  parse_date_time(.,'%b %d, %Y')

n_start <- which(apply(br_csv,1,function(x){substr(x,1,4)=="Name"}) == TRUE)
n_end <- max(which(apply(br_csv,1,function(x){str_count(x, ",")}) == 0)) - n_start -1
br_clean_csv <- read_csv(url_data_csv, skip = n_start, n_max = n_end)

with_dur <- br_clean_csv %>% 
  filter(Sector == "Treasuries") %>% 
  mutate(w_duration = `Weight (%)` * `Duration` / 100) %>% 
  mutate(days_to_mature = parse_date(`Maturity`,'%b %d, %Y'))

with_dur %>% filter(Sector == "Treasuries") %>% ggplot(., aes(x=`Duration`, y=`Coupon (%)`, color=`Price`)) + geom_point()


```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
