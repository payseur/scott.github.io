## In Current Dollars

1950 a gas cost \$0.27, in 2018 it cost \$2.50. Compare?

![](images/table_8_1.png){fig-align="center" width="562"}

$$
0.27 \: in \: $_{1950} \times \frac{100 \: in \: $_{2018}}{9.59 \: in \: $_{2050}}= 2.82 \: in \: $_{2018} 
$$

## Measures of Money Supply

![](images/table_8_2.png){fig-align="center" width="874"}

-   Fred data: [C](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CURRCIR) \| [MB](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGMBASE) \| [M1](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WM1NS) \| [M2](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WM2NS)

## The Quantity Equation

$$
M_t V_t = P_t Y_t
$$

-   $M_t$: amount of money

-   $V_t$: velocity of money

-   $P_t$: price level

-   $Y_t$: real GDP

## Quantity Theory of Money

![](images/table_8_3.png){fig-align="center"}

## Quantity Theory of Money

Solution:

$$
P_t^* = \frac{\bar{M_t}\bar{V}}{\bar{Y_t}}
$$

In the long run:

-   velocity of money and real GDP are taken as given.

-   a key determinant of price level is the money supply.

## Quantity Theory for Inflation

$$
M_t V_t = P_t Y_t 
$$

In growth rates:

$$
\bar{g_M} + \bar{g_V} = g_P + \bar{g_Y}
$$

Assume $\bar{g_V} = 0$ and inflation or growth in price level, $g_P$, is renamed $\pi$ .

$$
 \pi^* = \bar{g_M} -\bar{g_Y}
$$

## Quantity Theory for Inflation

Quantity theory implies that in the long run, changes in growth rate lead one-for-one to changes in inflation rate.

::: incremental
-   Example: $\bar{g_M}$ = 7%, $\bar{g_Y}$ = 4%, $\implies$ Inflation rate will be 3%

    -   Central bank increases money supply to 10% per year $\implies$ inflation rate 6%.

*Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.* - Milton Friedman

## Classical Dichotomy

::: incremental
-   Classical Dichotomy: real and nominal sides are separate in the **long run**.

-   Green paper to blue paper

-   Doubles money supply:

    -   all prices double

    -   relative prices are the same

    -   quantity produced and allocation does not change
:::

## Real and Nominal Interest Rates

::: incremental
-   Real interest rate - paid in goods

    -   Equal to the marginal product of capital.

    -   Total amount of consumption goods earned by:

        -   purchasing a unit of capital

        -   investing

-   Nominal interest rate - paid in currency

-   Price level helps us convert between the two.
:::

## Real and Nominal Interest Rates

The Fisher equation:

$$
i = R + \pi
$$

-   $R$ - Real interest rate

-   $i$ - Nominal interest rate

-   $\pi$ - Inflation rate

## Real and Nominal Interest Rates

$$
i = R + \pi
$$

::: incremental
-   Example: $R$ = 5% and $\pi$ =3% $\implies$  $i$ = 8%.

    -   Machine costs \$100

    -   Inflation $\implies$ in one year can sell it for \$103.

    -   Real interest rate $\implies$ can produce \$5 in one year.

    -   \$8 or 8% is the nominal interest rate.

Don't observe $R$.

 R=i-\pi

## Costs of Inflation

Mr Gambino - Fixed Pension

::: incremental
-   Started work in the 1940s - retired in 1970

-   Defined benefit pension of \$10,000 / yr

-   Eroded by inflation that pension was only worth \$4,000 in 1970's dollars

    -   Bought the same amount that \$4,000 would buy
:::

## Costs of Inflation

Ms Gaga - Bank Owner

::: incremental
-   Owns a bank - pays interest on bank deposits and lends to farmers

-   Loans are for 5, 10, 30 year fixed rates

-   Inflation rate increase leads to customers wanting more interest

    -   She increases interest or they leave
:::

## Costs of Inflation

Ms Swift - Home Owner

::: incremental
-   Buys a house with a floating rate mortgage ([current fixed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US))

    -   inflation is 3% and short-term interest rates 5%

    -   \$100,000 / month mortgage

-   Her income is \$200,000 after tax

-   Inflation jumps to 8% and short-term interest rates rise to 10%

-   Monthly payment is now \$200,000
:::

## Costs of Inflation

::: incremental
-   Low inflation leads to stability - people and institutions know what to expect.

-   Unexpected inflation - causes instability, spiraling behavior, economic distortions

-   **Shoe leather costs** - people don't want to hold cash.

-   **Menu costs** - hard to change prices for some companies.

## Fiscal Causes of High Inflation

Traditionally money is printed to fund government spending. The government budget constraint is:

$$
\underbrace{G}_{uses}=\underbrace{T + \Delta B + \Delta M}_{sources\:of\:funds}
$$

-   $G$ : goventment spending

-   $T$: tax revenue

-   $\Delta B$: change in stock of debt, amount of new borrowing

-   $\Delta M$: change in money stock, new money printed

## Inflation Tax

$$
\underbrace{G}_{uses}=\underbrace{T + \Delta B + \Delta M}_{sources\:of\:funds}
$$

Example:

::: incremental
-   Government decides to spend an extra \$100 million for social security

-   Option 1: Raise taxes, $T$

-   Option 2: Borrow money, $\Delta B$ \> 0

-   Option 3: Print money, $\Delta M$ \> 0, **seignorage** or **inflation tax.**
:::

## Inflation Tax

$$
\underbrace{G}_{uses}=\underbrace{T + \Delta B + \Delta M}_{sources\:of\:funds}
$$

Who pays **inflation tax**:

::: incremental
-   Suppose government decides to double the money supply.

-   Initially everyone has \$200.

-   In the long run, the price level, $P_t$ , doubles.

-   People holding currency must pay twice as much for goods.

-   What about people that invested in land? (only impacts currency holders)
:::

## Government Finances

::: incremental
-   Governments should finance spending through taxes and borrowing.

    -   As some governments borrow more they must pay higher interest rates.

    -   If deficit is \> 5% of GDP might find it hard politically to raise taxes.

-   This leads governments to print money leading to inflation taxes.

-   In some cases this can spiral and cause hyper inflation.

-   Central bank independence

::: {.column .incremental width="50%"}
-   Economy that averaged 2% inflation a year was now seeing 5%.

-   Feared a wage-price spiral (strong unions, manufacturing in USA)

-   8/1971: President Nixon announced a 90 day price freeze on wages and prices

-   Seemed to work, but OPEC came in roughly 1973

## 1970s Inflation: OPEC

::: {.column .incremental width="50%"}
-   OPEC - supplied a worldwide oil price shock

-   Was not due to government spending

-   Tried price controls - supply did not meet demand

    -   Led to rationing

-   Policy toolkit was not fully developed
