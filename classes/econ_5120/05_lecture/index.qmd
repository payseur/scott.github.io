## Different Types of Unemployment

$$
 actual\: unemployent = \underbrace{(frictional + structural)}_{natural} + cyclical
$$

::: incremental
-   Natural - rate that prevails if economy is neither boom nor recession.

-   Frictional - Employees changing jobs in a dynamic economy.

-   Structural - hiring/firing costs, unemployment benefits, minimum wage.

-   Cyclical - difference between actual and natural rates of unemployment
:::

## Bathtub Model of Unemployment

$$
 E_t - U_t = \bar{L}
$$

$$
\Delta U_{t+1} = \underbrace{\bar{s}E_t}_{emp\:lose\:jobs} - \underbrace{\bar{f}U_t}_{unemp\:find\: new\: jobs}
$$

::: incremental
-   Job separation rate: $\bar{s}$

-   Job finding rate: $\bar{f}$

-   Steady State: $\Delta U_{t+1} = 0$

-   Imaging bathtub with water on and drain open.
:::

## Bathtub Model of Unemployment

In steady state:

$$
 U^* = \frac{\bar{s}\bar{L}}{\bar{f}+\bar{s}}, \: \: \:u^* \equiv \frac{U^*}{\bar{L}} = \frac{\bar{s}}{\bar{f}+\bar{s}}
$$\

Natural rate of unemployment when $\bar{s} = 0.01$ and $\bar{f}=0.2$ is:

$$
 u^* = \frac{.01}{.2+.01}= 0.048 \approx 5\%
$$

$$
pdv = \$100\times \frac{1-\left(\frac{1}{(1+R)}\right)^{20}}{1-\frac{1}{(1+R)}}
$$

## Present Discounted Value

One time pdv:

## The Quantity Equation

$$
M_t V_t = P_t Y_t
$$

-   $M_t$: amount of money

-   $V_t$: velocity of money

-   $P_t$: price level

-   $Y_t$: real GDP

## Quantity Theory of Money

![](images/table_8_3.png){fig-align="center"}

::: footer
Source: [Macroeconomics, Jones, 2021](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393417326)
:::

## Quantity Theory of Money

Solution:

$$
P_t^* = \frac{\bar{M_t}\bar{V}}{\bar{Y_t}}
$$

In the long run:

-   velocity of money and real GDP are taken as given.

-   a key determinant of price level is the money supply.

## Quantity Theory for Inflation

$$
M_t V_t = P_t Y_t 
$$

In growth rates:

$$
\bar{g_M} + \bar{g_V} = g_P + \bar{g_Y}
$$

Assume $\bar{g_V} = 0$ and inflation or growth in price level, $g_P$, is renamed $\pi$ .

$$
 \pi^* = \bar{g_M} -\bar{g_Y}
$$

## Quantity Theory for Inflation

Quantity theory implies that in the long run, changes in growth rate lead one-for-one to changes in inflation rate.

::: incremental
-   Example: $\bar{g_M}$ = 7%, $\bar{g_Y}$ = 4%, $\implies$ Inflation rate will be 3%

    -   Central bank increases money supply to 10% per year $\implies$ inflation rate 6%.

## Classical Dichotomy

::: incremental

-   Green paper to blue paper

-   Doubles money supply:

    -   all prices double

    -   relative prices are the same

    -   quantity produced and allocation does not change
:::

## Real and Nominal Interest Rates

::: incremental
-   Real interest rate - paid in goods

    -   Equal to the marginal product of capital.

    -   Total amount of consumption goods earned by:

        -   purchasing a unit of capital

        -   investing

-   Nominal interest rate - paid in currency

-   Price level helps us convert between the two.
:::

## Real and Nominal Interest Rates

The Fisher equation:

$$
i = R + \pi
$$

-   $R$ - Real interest rate

-   $i$ - Nominal interest rate

-   $\pi$ - Inflation rate

## Real and Nominal Interest Rates

$$
i = R + \pi
$$

::: incremental
-   Example: $R$ = 5% and $\pi$ =3% $\implies$ $i$ = 8%.

    -   Machine costs \$100

    -   Inflation $\implies$ in one year can sell it for \$103.

    -   Real interest rate $\implies$ can produce \$5 in one year.

    -   \$8 or 8% is the nominal interest rate.
:::

## Real and Nominal Interest Rates

Don't observe $R$.

$$
 R=i-\pi

    -   Bought the same amount that \$4,000 would buy
:::

## Costs of Inflation

Ms Gaga - Bank Owner

::: incremental
-   Owns a bank - pays interest on bank deposits and lends to farmers

-   Loans are for 5, 10, 30 year fixed rates

-   Inflation rate increase leads to customers wanting more interest

    -   She increases interest or they leave
:::

## Costs of Inflation

Ms Swift - Home Owner

::: incremental
-   Buys a house with a floating rate mortgage ([current fixed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US))

    -   inflation is 3% and short-term interest rates 5%

    -   \$100,000 / month mortgage

-   Her income is \$200,000 after tax

-   Inflation jumps to 8% and short-term interest rates rise to 10%

-   Monthly payment is now \$200,000
:::

## Costs of Inflation

::: incremental
-   Low inflation leads to stability - people and institutions know what to expect.

-   Unexpected inflation - causes instability, spiraling behavior, economic distortions

-   **Shoe leather costs** - people don't want to hold cash.

-   **Menu costs** - hard to change prices for some companies.
:::

## Fiscal Causes of High Inflation

Traditionally money is printed to fund government spending. The government budget constraint is:

$$
\underbrace{G}_{uses}=\underbrace{T + \Delta B + \Delta M}_{sources\:of\:funds}
$$

-   $G$ : goventment spending

-   $T$: tax revenue

-   $\Delta B$: change in stock of debt, amount of new borrowing

-   $\Delta M$: change in money stock, new money printed

## Inflation Tax

$$
\underbrace{G}_{uses}=\underbrace{T + \Delta B + \Delta M}_{sources\:of\:funds}
$$

Example:

::: incremental
-   Government decides to spend an extra \$100 million for social security

-   Option 1: Raise taxes, $T$

-   Option 2: Borrow money, $\Delta B$ \> 0

-   Option 3: Print money, $\Delta M$ \> 0, **seignorage** or **inflation tax.**
:::

## Inflation Tax

$$
\underbrace{G}_{uses}=\underbrace{T + \Delta B + \Delta M}_{sources\:of\:funds}
$$

Who pays **inflation tax**:

::: incremental
-   Suppose government decides to double the money supply.

-   Initially everyone has \$200.

-   In the long run, the price level, $P_t$ , doubles.

-   People holding currency must pay twice as much for goods.

-   What about people that invested in land? (only impacts currency holders)
:::

## Government Finances

::: incremental
-   Governments should finance spending through taxes and borrowing.

    -   As some governments borrow more they must pay higher interest rates.

    -   If deficit is \> 5% of GDP might find it hard politically to raise taxes.

-   This leads governments to print money leading to inflation taxes.

-   In some cases this can spiral and cause hyper inflation.

-   Central bank independence

    -   Current inflation

    -   Current unemployment
:::

## Trend vs Cycles

$$
 \underbrace{actual\:output}_{Y_t} = \underbrace{long-run\:outout}_{\bar{Y_t}} +  \underbrace{short-run\:fluxuations}_{\tilde{Y_t}}

Cycles in percentage terms:

$$
\tilde{Y_t}=\frac{Y_t-\bar{Y_t}}{\bar{Y_t}}
$$

$\tilde{Y_t}$ is called: short-run output, detrended output, short-run cycle

## Recession Costs

::: incremental
-   In the GFC recession output lost:

    -   GDP was close to \$20 Trillion

    -   Short-run output was close to -6% or \~ \$1 Trillion

    -   \$3,000 per person or \$12,000 per household

-   In the GFC recession jobs lost:

    -   8.2 million

## Measuring Potential Output

::: incremental
-   Is not observable!

-   Take GDP and look at smooth trend

-   Congressional Budget Office uses a version of the Solow Model

    -   Feature of this approach: slowdown in investment following the GFC means potential output as slowed as well.

-   Models are tuned and updated based on HF data

-   What is a change in potential output vs a short-run fluctuation?
:::

## Phillips Curve

Dynamic trade-off between output and inflation.

::: incremental
-   Government can stimulate economy

    -   Booming economy today (producing more than potential output)

        -   Leads to an increase in the inflation rate

-   If inflation rate is high policy makers can lower it

    -   A recession is typically required (producing less than potential output)

::: {.column .incremental width="50%"}
-   Booming economy, $\tilde{Y}>0$, results in higher inflation, $\Delta \pi >0$ .
-   Recession, $\tilde{Y}<0$, results in lower inflation, $\Delta \pi < 0$ .
-   Next two chapters discuss how monetary policy is used to change $\tilde{Y}$.

## Phillips Curve

In the short-run a booming economy leads to increased inflation, and a slumping economy leads to decreased inflation.

::: {.column .incremental width="50%"}
-   Slope is roughly 1/3

-   When output exceeds potential $\implies$ inflation rate increase by 1%

Output and Unemployment

$$
 u-\bar{u} = -\frac{1}{2} \times \tilde{Y}
$$

$u$ : unemployment

$\bar{u}$ : natural rate of unemployment
