## Chapter 16: Consumption

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   Neoclassical consumption

    -   Based on rational individuals who choose the time path of their consumption to maximize utility

    -   Subject to intertxemporal budget constraint.

    -   We consider two periods: today and future.

-   The solution reinforces our view of the permanent income hypothesis: consumption in each period is a fraction of total wealth.

    -   Total wealth: financial resources, current income, present value of future income.

-   The solution can be expressed in terms of an Euler equation for consumption

    -   Individuals are indifferent between consuming a little more today and saving a little more for consumption in the future.
:::

## Chapter 16: Consumption

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   Individuals will seek to smooth out any shocks to current and future income, suggesting that marginal propensity to consume out of a temporary increase in current income is likely to be small.

    -   Two forces counterbalance this low marginal propensity to consume.

        -   Individuals who are constrained from borrowing in credit markets.

        -   Individuals that engage inn precautionary savings.

    -   Data is consistent with this theory - suggesting that the permanent-income model is a good benchmark for describing consumption of well-off individuals, while poorer consumers have a high marginal propensity to spend.

-   Aggregate data shows a rise in debt as ratio to income and a decline in personal savings in recent decades.
:::

## Neoclassical Consumption Model

::: incremental
-   Consumption over time - but we can make progress by thinking of time involving only two periods

    -   Today and the future

-   People earn income today and the future, consume today and the future, **how much do they consume today and in the future**?

-   Consumption model is based on two main elements:

    -   Intertemporal budget constraint

    -   Utility function
:::

## Intertemporal Budget Constraint

::: incremental
-   Irving has financial wealth of $f_{today}$

-   Two time periods $today$ and $future$ .

-   Let $c$ represent consumption and $y$ represent income, Irving faces the following two budget constraints:

    -   $c_{today} + (f_{future} - f_{today})=y_{today}$

    -   $c_{future} = y_{future} + (1+R) f_{future}$

        -   $(f_{future} - f_{today})$ represents savings for the future.
:::

## Intertemporal Budget Constraint

::: {style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center"}
$c_{today} + (f_{future} - f_{today})=y_{today}$

$c_{future} = y_{future} + (1+R) f_{future}$
:::

Example, no starting financial wealth:

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   $f_{today} = 0, f_{future}=0$

-   $y_{today} - c_{today} = 0 \implies (f_{future}-f_{today}) = 0$

-   $y_{future} +(1+R)f_{future} - c_{future} = 0$

    -   $c_{future} = y_{future}$
:::

## Intertemporal Budget Constraint

::: {style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center"}
$c_{today} + (f_{future} - f_{today})=y_{today}$

$c_{future} = y_{future} + (1+R) f_{future}$
:::

Example, no starting financial wealth, **save 20 for future**:

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   $f_{today} = 0, f_{future}=20$

-   $y_{today} - c_{today} = 20 \implies (f_{future}-f_{today}) = 20$

-   $y_{future} +(1+R)f_{future} - c_{future} = 0$

    -   $c_{future} = y_{future} + (1+R)(20)$
:::

## Intertemporal Budget Constraint

::: {style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center"}
$c_{today} + (f_{future} - f_{today})=y_{today}$

$c_{future} = y_{future} + (1+R) f_{future}$
:::

Example, no starting financial wealth, **borrow 20 from future**:

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   $f_{today} = 0, f_{future}=-20$

-   $y_{today} - c_{today} = -20 \implies (f_{future}-f_{today}) = -20$

-   $y_{future} +(1+R)f_{future} - c_{future} = 0$

    -   $c_{future} = y_{future} + (1+R)(-20)$
:::

## Intertemporal Budget Constraint

::: {style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center"}
$c_{today} + (f_{future} - f_{today})=y_{today}$

$c_{future} = y_{future} + (1+R) f_{future}$
:::

Example, start with 20 financial wealth, **save 10 for future**:

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   $f_{today} = 10, f_{future}=10$

-   $y_{today} - c_{today} = -10 \implies (f_{future}-f_{today}) = 10$

-   $y_{future} +(1+R)f_{future} - c_{future} = 0$

    -   $c_{future} = y_{future} + (1+R)(10)$
:::

## Intertemporal Budget Constraint

::: {style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center"}
$c_{today} + (f_{future} - f_{today})=y_{today}$

$c_{future} = y_{futue} + (1+R) f_{future}$
:::

\

Combine equations to get a two period constraint:

\

::: {style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center"}
$c_{today} + \frac{c_{future}}{1+R} = f_{today} +y_{today} + \frac{y_{future}}{1+R}$

$Present\:Value\:of\:Consumption = \underbrace{Financial\:Wealth + Human\: Wealth}_{Total\:Wealth}$
:::

## Intertemporal Budget Constraint

::: {style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center"}
$Present\:Value\:of\:Consumption = \underbrace{Financial\:Wealth + Human\: Wealth}_{Total\:Wealth}$
:::

::: incremental
-   Present value of consumption

-   Human wealth - present value of labor income

-   Endowed financial wealth

-   At the end of life Irving has zero
:::

## Utility Function

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/figure_16_1.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
In order to quantify the value of consumption we use a Utility function.

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   If Irving consumes some amount, $c$ , in a given period, we assume that he receives $u(c)$ units of utility.

    -   We will call these units *Utils*

-   Classic assumption: the more Irving consumes the less utility Irving has - *Law of diminishing marginal utility.*
:::
:::
:::

## Lifetime Utility Function

::: {style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center"}
$U = u(c_{today})+\beta u(c_{future})$
:::

::: incremental
-   Lifetime Utility depends on two periods

-   The parameter, $\beta$, captures the weight that Irving places on the future, relative to today.

-   If $\beta =1$ then Irving treats utils received today and in the future equally.

-   Alternatively, if $\beta <1$ , a given flow of utility is worth more when it occurs today.
:::

## Maximizing Utility

::: {style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center"}
$max_{c_{today}, c_{future}}\:U = u(c_{today})+\beta u(c_{future})$, subject to

$c\_{today}+ \left( \frac{c_{future}}{1+R} \right) = \bar{X}$,

where $\bar{X}$ denotes total wealth $\bar{X}=f_{today} +y_{today} + \frac{y_{future}}{1+R}$
:::

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   Could solve with calculus

-   Instead use intuition.

    -   Irving consumes a little more today the marginal utility will be $u'(c_{today})$.

    -   Irving consumes a little more tomorrow the marginal utility will be $\beta u'(c_{future})$.

    -   Combine with intertemporal budget constraint.

    -   If he has maximized utility, Irving must be indifferent between consuming today or in the future.
:::

## Euler Equation

::: {style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center"}
$u'(c_{today})=\beta (1+R) u'(c_{future})$
:::

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   If Irving has maximized utility, he must be indifferent between consuming today or in the future

-   Why? if moving consumption from today to the future would increase utility, he would not be at a maximum.

-   This *indifference equation* is called the *Euler equation*.

    -   Marginal utility today = adjusted marginal utility in the future.
:::

## Solving Euler Equation

::: {style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center"}
$\frac{c_{today}}{c_{today}}=\beta (1+R)$
:::

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   In order to get an explicit solution for consumption we must specify a functional form for $u(.)$.

-   A common choice is $u(c)=log(c)$.

    -   Diminishing marginal utility

    -   $u(c) = log(c) \implies u'(c)=\frac{1}{c}$

    -   The Euler Equation can be written as $\frac{1}{c_{today}}=\beta (1+R) \frac{1}{c_{future}}$
:::

## Solving Euler Equation

::: {style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center"}
$\frac{c_{today}}{c_{today}}=\beta (1+R)$
:::

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   Says that Irving will choose consumption so that the growth rate of consumption is the product of $\beta$ and the interest he can earn on his savings $1+R$.

-   The Euler equation in terms of consumption growth reveals another deep insight into macroeconomics.

    -   Interest rates and growth rates are similar numbers, like 2%.

    -   Irving chooses his consumption rate given $R$. And so does everyone else.

    -   Produces a general equilibrium value.
:::

## Euler Equation Insights

::: {style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center"}
$\frac{c_{today}}{c_{today}}=\beta (1+R)$
:::

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   Suppose the long-run growth rate of the economy and consumption (from Solow/Romer type models) is 2% per year.

-   If $\beta = 1$ the Euler equation implies that the real interest rate will be 2%.

-   If $\beta < 1$ , consumers prefer to get their utility today instead of the future driving interest rates a little higher than 2%.

-   The key here is the *Euler equation explains how interest rates and growth rates are linked.*
:::

## Effect of $\uparrow R$ on Consumption

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   A higher interest rate will reduce the present value of labor income, therefore reducing consumption in the case of log utility. This force is called the *wealth effect* of higher interest rates because it works through the total wealth term.

-   The *substitution effect* of a higher interest rate is that current consumption becomes more expensive so consumers will tend to reduce consumption today.

-   The *income effect* of a higher interest rate says that consumers are now richer - because their current saving leads to more income in the future - which makes them want to consume more now.

-   In general it can go either way because these effects work in *opposite directions*.
:::

## Permanent-Income Hypothesis

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/figure_16_2.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column .incremental width="50%" style="font-size: 25px"}
-   Consumption depends on some average value of income rather than just current income.

-   This is one implication of the neoclasssical consumption model.

-   Because of diminishing marginal utility Irving prefers to smooth consumption and take the average in both periods.

-   Lifetime utility is $u(\bar{c})$ instead of average utility between $c_1$ and $c_2$.

-   In this example 1/2 is called the marginal propensity to consume, if income goes up \$1 temporarily consumption rises by 1/2 that amount.

:::

## Ricardian Equivalence

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 33px"}
-   Ricardian approach to the government is that consumption depends on the present discounted value of taxes and in invariant to timing of the taxes.

-   Our intertemporal budget constraint comes after taxes.

-   If there is a large tax in the future we will consume less now.

-   If there is a large tax now we will consume less in the future.

-   Lack of transparency can lead to more/less consumption.
:::

## Borrowing Constraints

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   A key assumption in our model is that Irving was free to save or borrow in each period.

-   There are some consumers that do not have this option.

    -   No financial wealth

    -   Unable to borrow in credit markets

-   In this case the intertemporal budget constraint is $c_{today} \le y_{today}$ .

    -   If Irving is consuming less than income he can save for future.

    -   If Irving is consuming all income the constraint is binding.
:::

## Random Walk Consumption

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   Is Irving's income certain? Is yours?

-   Our neoclassical utility framework has not included uncertainty - all information about the future is known.

-   Some income increases are expected like a promotion after $x$ years. Some are unexpected like winning the lottery.

-   Random walk view of consumption.

-   Because all known information should be incorporated into current consumption, changes in consumption should be modeled as uncertain.

-   Each step of the process is random, for instance %-age change is based on $N(0,\sigma)$ .
:::

## Precautionary Savings

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   Its possible that Irving is facing a large drop in income, perhaps unemployment or disability.

-   Saving for such a case is called precautionary savings.

-   Such a consumer might save even when income and wealth are temporarily low, permanent income hypothesis would suggest borrowing.

    -   As long as the possibility remains that income could fall even further, consumers may engage in precautionary savings to insure themselves against that outcome.

    -   For example, savings rates rose sharply during the financial crisis.

## Chapter 17: Investment

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   Investment of all kinds are ways of transferring resources from the present to the future:

    -   Physical capital, Human capital, New Ideas, Financial Assets

-   **Arbitrage equation** is a fundamental tool for studying investment of all types.

    -   It says that two investments of equal riskiness must have the same return (otherwise everyone will flock to the investment with the higher return).

    -   Typically this equation has the form that says the interest rate is equal to the sum of a *dividend* return and a *capital gain* return, both in percentage terms.

-   The arbitrage argument applied to physical capital leads to a key result: *firms invest in physical capital until marginal product of capital falls to equal the user cost of capital.*
:::

## Chapter 17: Investment

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   The **user cost of capital** is the total economic cost of using one unit of capital for one period.

    -   It typically involves the interest rate, depreciation rate, and any capital gain/loss.

    -   Can also be augmented by taxation or subsidies.

-   Applying the arbitrage argument to financial investments lead to a simple theory of stock prices: the price of a stock is the present discounted value of dividends.

    -   Written as the ratio of the current dividend to the difference between the interest rate and the capital gain.
:::

## Chapter 17: Investment

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   If financial markets are informationally efficient, then stock prices will reflect all publicly available information.

    -   Only unexpected *news* will change stock prices, making them equally likely to go up or down (apart from a trend return).

    -   Stocks prices will follow a random walk.

-   Arbitrage argument applied to housing means that the price of a house should equal the present discounted value of the amount the house can be rented for (adjusted for leverage).

-   Inventory investment is highly pro-cyclical, rising sharply in booms and falling in recessions.
:::

## Investment

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 34px"}
-   Investment can be into new ideas, human capital, financial assets.

-   In the **national income accounting** sense it refers to the accumulation of physical capital:

    -   Roads, Houses, Computers, Machine Tools

-   Key: it is by investing that our actions **today** influence our **opportunities in the future**.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

-   Investment typically makes up 15-20% of US GDP

-   During 2006-2009 investment share of GDP fell from 20% to 13%.

    -   Typically investment fluctuates more than consumption, falls disproportionately.

-   As we have seen in our long-run models investment is the heart of economic growth.

-   Amazon / Walmart / Gino's East

-   Model of production, Cobb-Douglas: $Y=\bar{A}K^{1/3}L^{2/3}$

-   Businesses should invest in physical capital until the MPC falls equal to the rental price of capital, $R$.

    -   Invest until $MPK=\frac{1}{3}\bar{A} \left( \frac{L}{K}\right)^{2/3} = \frac{1}{3} \frac{Y}{K} = R$
:::

## Investment Arbitrage Equation

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 35px"}
-   Investors have two possible investments

    -   Each have the same amount of risk.

    -   A profit maximizing investor will choose the investment that offers the larger profit.

    -   This bids up the price of that investment.

    -   In the end the two investments will yield the same.

    -   This is the arbitrage equation.
:::

## Gino's East

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 35px"}
-   Suppose Gino's East can buy a pizza oven for $p_k$.

-   Gino's can do two things with cash on hand:

    -   Put money in the bank for one year and earn $R \times p_k$

    -   Buy a pizza oven for one year year and earn $MPK + \Delta p_k$

    -   $\Delta p_k$ is the capital gain/loss on the oven

-   Arbitrage equation: $R \times p_k = MPK + \Delta p_k$

-   Rearrange: $MPK = R - \frac{\Delta p_k}{p_k}$

    -   Note: with if no capital gains/losses this is our solution from long-term growth chapters.
:::

## User Cost of Capital

$$
 \underbrace{R \times p_k}_{return\:from\:bank} = \underbrace{MPK + \Delta p_k}_{return\:from\:oven}
$$

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 35px"}
-   Richer solution than long-run growth equation

    -   Price of ovens changing over time

-   Define growth rate of price: $\frac{\Delta p_k}{p_k}$

    -   Capital gain (+), Capital loss (-)

    -   Start the year with an oven worth \$10,000, by the end of the year it is worth \$8,000. There is a capital loss of -20%.
:::

## User Cost of Capital

$$
 MPK = \underbrace{R + \bar{d} - \frac{\Delta p_k}{p_k}}_{user\:cost\:of\:capital}
$$

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 35px"}
-   Many reasons why capital loss is common: depreciation, technology, etc.

-   Capital gain is common in structures on land, which becomes increasingly scarce.

-   Place depreciation explicitly in the equation.

## Desired Capital to Investment

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 25px"}
$$
MPK=\frac{1}{3}\bar{A} \left( \frac{L}{K}\right)^{2/3} = \frac{1}{3} \frac{Y}{K}
$$

MPK equals UCC

$$
\frac{Y}{K}=3 \times uc
$$

accumulation equation:

$$
K_{t+1}= I_t+(1-\bar{d})K_t \implies \frac{\Delta K_{t+1}}{K_t} =\frac{I_t}{Y_t}\frac{Y_t}{K_t}-\bar{d}
$$

define $g_K \equiv \Delta K_{t+1}/K_t$ and combine

$$
\frac{I_t}{Y_t}=\frac{g_K+\bar{d}}{3 \times uc}
$$

Higher user cost of capital leads to lower investment.

## Stock Market and Investment

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 35px"}
-   Capital and investment refer to accumulation of physical (or intellectual) capital in macroeconomics.

-   Investment often used in finance.

    -   Financial capital, Net worth of an institution, making a financial investment into a mutual fund

-   Main similarity: arbitrage equation.

## Stock Market Arbitrage Eq

$$
 \underbrace{R \times p_s}_{return\:from\:bank} = \underbrace{dividend + \Delta p_s}_{return\:from\:the\:stock}
$$

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 35px"}
-   Investor can put money in bank account and earn $R$ per year.

-   Investor can put money in stock market and earn a dividend plus capital gain/loss per year.

    -   Note: we assume the same risk!

-   $R = \underbrace{\frac{dividend}{p_s}}_{\%\:div\:return} + \underbrace{\frac{\Delta p_s}{p_s}}_{\%\:capital\:gain}$

## Price of a Stock

$$
 R = \underbrace{\frac{dividend}{p_s}}_{\%\:div\:return} + \underbrace{\frac{\Delta p_s}{p_s}}_{\%\:capital\:gain}
$$

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 35px"}
-   Solve for the price of a stock.

-   $p_s = \frac{dividend}{R-\frac{\Delta p_s}{p_s}} = \frac{dividend}{interest\:rate - capital\:gain}$
