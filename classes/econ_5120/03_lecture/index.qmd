## Chapters 4, 5, 6

-   4 - Introduce a production model

-   5 - Add investment, consumption, and depreciation (Solow)

-   6 - Production model of ideas (Romer)

## Production Function

$$
Y = F(K, L) = \bar{A}K^{1/3}L^{2/3} 
$$ {#eq-productionmodel}

-   $\bar{A}$ - Productivity parameter.

-   $K$ - Capital

-   $r$ - Rental price of capital

-   $L$ - Labor

-   $w$ - Wage

Cobb-Douglass ([link](https://assets.aeaweb.org/asset-server/journals/aer/top20/18.1.139-165.pdf)): $Y = K^{a}L^{1-a}$

## Output Per Person

<div>

-   Output per person: $y\equiv Y/L$

-   Capital per person: $k\equiv K/L$

-   Output per person in equilibrium:

    -   $y^*\equiv \frac{Y^*}{L^*} = \frac{\bar{A}\bar{K}^{1/3}\bar{L}^{2/3}}{\bar{L}}=\frac{\bar{A}\bar{K}^{1/3}}{\bar{L}^{1/3}} = \bar{A}\bar{k}^{1/3}$
    -   Output per person is a function of:
        -   Capital per person

        -   Productivity parameter

</div>

## Empirical Fit of the Production Model

<div>

-   Use development accounting - use model to account for differences between countries.

-   Replace ice cream with real economy.

-   Capital per person, $\bar{k}$, measured in economies stock of housing, factories, tractors, computers, machines and other capital goods.

-   Focus on $y^*=\bar{A}\bar{k}^{1/3}$

-   Assume $\bar{A}=1$

</div>

## Growth Accounting Burundi

$$
\frac{y^*_{rich}}{y^*_{poor}}=\frac{\bar{A}_{rich}}{\bar{A}_{poor}}\left(\frac{\bar{k}_{rich}}{\bar{k}_{poor}}\right)^{1/3}
$$

From charts numerators = 1, $\bar{A}_{poor} = \frac{1}{13}$, $\bar{k}_{poor}^{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{5}$.

$$
\frac{y^*_{US}}{y^*_{Burundi}}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{12}}\left(\frac{1}{\frac{1}{6}}\right) = 12 \times 6
$$

Per capita gdp difference explained by 67% TFP, and 33% by capital per person.

## Production Model Summary

::: incremental
-   Constant returns to scale production function: $Y = \bar{A}K^{1/3}L^{2/3}$

-   Kept $L$ exogenous: $L = \bar{L}$

-   Explored replacing $\bar{A}$ with $TFP$.

-   What is missing?
:::

## Chapter 5: Solow Growth Model

::: incremental
-   Capital goods depreciate

-   Investment happens

-   Why do we see massive wealth growth in some countries but not others?

-   Introduce steady state and transition dynamics
:::

## South Korea and Philippines

::: incremental
-   1960 - similar per capita GDP \~ \$1,500 in each country

-   Similar populations / industries

-   Between 1960 and 2017 economies diverged drastically

-   Annual GDP per capita growth - PH **2.5%**, S. Korea **6%**

-   2017 per capita GDP - PH **\$7,700**, S.Korea **\$36,000**

-   Why? Solow: capital accumulation!
:::

## Solow Model

$$
Y = F(K, L) = \bar{A}K_t^{1/3}L_t^{2/3} 
$$

Resource constraint:

$$
C_t+I_t=Y_t
$$

Capital accumulation:

$$
K_{t+1}=K_t+I_t-\bar{d}K_t
$$

## Depreciation

::: incremental
-   $\bar{d}$ : depreciation of capital each period in percentage terms

-   Capital goods wear out / or are used up each period

    -   Computers / Machines / Facilities

-   Economists think of $\bar{d}$ to be somewhere between 7-10% a year

-   Define: $\Delta K_{t+1} \equiv K_{t+1} - K_t$

-   Change over time: $\Delta K_{t+1} = I_t - \bar{d}K_t$.
:::

## Capital Stock Example

::: incremental
-   Initial capital stock, $\bar{K_0}$, or capital at time $t=0$, is equal to 1,000.

-   Depreciation rate, $\bar{d}$, is equal to 10%.

-   Investment, $I_t$, is a constant of 200 per period.

-   How does the capital stock evolve over time?
:::

## Allocation of output - Investment.

::: incremental
-   In the Solow Growth Model resources can go to Consumption, $C_t$, or Investment, $I_t$.

    -   Note: Government, $G_t$, and Trade, $NX_t$, is not in the model.

-   Define $\bar{s} \in [0,1]$ as the fraction of output that is invested each period.
:::

## Allocation of Output - Investment

$$
I_t=\bar{s}Y_t
$$

Plug into resource constraint:

$$
C_t=(1-\bar{s})Y_t
$$

## Compare to Production Model

::: incremental
-   No prices, $w$ or $r$.

-   Time subscript, $t$.

-   Capital stock is not constant.

    -   Capital growth is a function of savings/investment rate, $\bar{s}$.

    -   Capital loss is a function of depreciation, $\bar{d}$.

-   Choice between allocation of output, consumption or investment.

-   Keep labor exogenous, $L_t=\bar{L}$.
:::

## Real Interest Rate

Real interest rate is the amount a person can earn by saving one unit of output for a year, or the amount that a person must pay to borrow one unit of output for the year.

$$
\underbrace{Y_t -C_t}_{saving} = \underbrace{I_t}_{investment}
$$

The real interest rate equals the rental price of capital that clears the capital market, which in turn is equal to the marginal product of capital.

## Solving the Solow Model

Dynamic model that cannot be solved like the production model, but we can do two things:

::: incremental
1.  Show what a solution looks like graphically.
2.  Solve the model in the ***Long Run***.
:::

## Solving the Solow Model

$$
\underbrace{\Delta K_{t+1}}_{change-in-capital}=\underbrace{\bar{s}Y_t-\bar{d}K_t}_{net-investment}
$$

The change in capital stock is equal to the change in investment $I_t=\bar{s}Y_t$ less depreciation \$\\bar{d}K_t\$. $I_t=\bar{d}K_t$ is often called *net investment*.

$$
Y_t = \bar{A}K_t^{1/3}\bar{L}^{2/3}
$$

Two unknowns: $K_t$ and $Y_t$.

## Steady State

::: incremental
-   Steady-state level of capital, $K^*$, is determined at: $\bar{s}Y^* = \bar{d}K*$.

-   Substituting from the production function we find $\bar{s}\bar{A}K^{*1/3}\bar{L}^{2/3}=\bar{d}K^*$

-   Solve for $K^*$

-   Solve for $Y^*$
:::

## Steady State

$$
K^*= \left( \frac{\bar{s}\bar{A}}{\bar{d}} \right)^{3/2}\bar{L}
$$

$$
Y^*=\left(\frac{\bar{s}}{\bar{d}} \right)^{1/2}\bar{A}^{3/2}\bar{L}
$$

$$
y^* \equiv \left( \frac{Y^*}{L^*} \right) = \bar{A}^{3/2} \left( \frac{\bar{s}}{\bar{d}} \right)^{1/2} 
$$
