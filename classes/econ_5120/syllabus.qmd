## Objective

The goal of the course is to develop a theoretical framework for thinking about how macroeconomic variables such as GDP, unemployment, and inflation are determined. This framework is then used to interpret recent economic performance and to analyze how governmental policies have affected outcomes. To be clear, the course has dual objectives: to enhance your understanding of recent macroeconomic events AND to gain competence building and using economic models.
