## Question 1

::: {style="font-size: 15px"}
Using the FRED database construct a graph containing two data series

-   Real GDP ("GDPC1").

-   Real government consumption and investment expenditures ("GCEC1").

\(a\) Display a graph from 2004 to 2019, with real government spending on the right hand axis.

Below.

\(b\) How did government purchases co-move with Real GDP during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008?

There is a negative relationship between government spending and real GDP during the GFC.

\(c\) Ceteris Paribus (holding everything else constant) discuss how the aggregate demand parameter, $\bar{a}$, changed during the GFC with and without fiscal spending.

$\bar{a} \equiv \bar{a}_c + \bar{a}_i + \bar{a}_g + \bar{a}_{ex} - \bar{a}_{im} -1$ the collapse of the housing market likely shifted the IS curve by lowering $\bar{a}_c$ and $\bar{a}_i$ . The government tried to offset this shift by increasing $\bar{a}_g$ with fiscal spending.

-   The productivity slowdown and the Great Inflation: Using the IS-MP diagram and the Phillips curve, explain how the productivity slowdown of the 1970s may have contributed to the Great Inflation. In particular, answer the following:

    -   \(a\) Suppose growth in actual output is slowing down, as shown in Figure 12.13. Policymakers believe this is occurring because of a negative shock to aggregate demand. Explain how such a shock would account for the slowdown using an IS-MP diagram.

    -   \(b\) With this belief, what monetary policy action would policymakers take to stabilize the economy? Show this in the IS-MP diagram, as perceived by policymakers.

    -   \(c\) In truth, there was a slowdown in potential output, as also shown in Figure 12.13. Show the effect of monetary policy on short-run output in the "true" IS-MP diagram.

    -   \(d\) Show the effect of this monetary policy in a graph of the Phillips curve. Explain what happens

-   This question asks you to use the FRED database to predict the fed funds
    rate using the chapter\'s monetary policy rule. Of course, there are many
    possible inflation measures you could use. This question lets you
    consider two common ones.

    -   \(a\) The Fed likes to focus on the price index for personal consumption
        expenditures excluding food and energy---the so-called \"core\" measure of inflation. This is the series \"JCXFE\" in the FRED database. Display a
        graph of the inflation rate using this measure since 2000. What is the
        most recent 12-month inflation rate? \

    -   4.90%

    -   \(b\) As an alternative, consider the price index for personal consumption
        expenditures without excluding food and energy. This is the series
        \"PCECTPI\" in the FRED database. Display a graph of the inflation rate
        using this measure since 2000. What is the most recent 12-month
        inflation rate measured this way?\

    -   6.28%

    -   \(c\) Why do you think the two measures are different (if they are)?

    -   PCECTPI includes energy and food prices. Prices for food and energy are known to be more volatile than other prices (especially energy). This can be seen in the GFC with a large spike in energy prices followed by a deflationary print. Currently, it is 1.75% higher than "core" consumer expenditures.

    possible inflation measures you could use. This question lets you
    consider two common ones.

    -   \(d\) Using each of these recent inflation rates and the monetary policy rule
        considered in this chapter, produce an estimate of the appropriate fed
        funds rate for the U.S. economy. (Use $\bar{r}=2,\bar{m}=0.5,\bar{\pi}=2$ .) Discuss how these rates compare to the actual fed funds rate. (Hint: Be sure that you are comparing two nominal rates; our simple rule corresponds to a real rate.) \

    -   PCE Core implies: 8.3%, Including energy and food implies: 10.4%. This is far above the current fed funds rate of 2.19% (as of sep 2022).

## Question 4

::: {style="font-size: 15px"}
\(a\) Why does the AS curve slope upward?

If short-run output is greater than zero, firms see the opportunity to set prices higher, and inflation goes up.

\(b\) Why does the AD curve slope downward?

As inflation increases, central banks raise real rates, decreasing output.

\(c\) What kind of economic changes in the economy would lead to the AS curve to be more steeply sloped?

The demand conditions multiplier, $\bar{v}$, increases.

\(d\) What kind of economic changes in the economy would lead to the AD curve to be more steeply sloped?

An increase in the aggressiveness of monetary policy, $\bar{m}$.
