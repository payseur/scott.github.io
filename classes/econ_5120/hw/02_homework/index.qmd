## Question 1: (b) & (c)

b\. There is a negative relationship between government spending and real gdp during the GFC.

c\. $\bar{a} \equiv \bar{a}_c + \bar{a}_i + \bar{a}_g + \bar{a}_{ex} - \bar{a}_{im} -1$ the collapse of the housing market likely shifted the IS curve by lowering $\bar{a}_c$ and $\bar{a}_i$ . The government tried to offset this shift by increasing $\bar{a}_g$ with fiscal spending.

## Question 3: (c)

PCECTPI includes energy and food prices. Prices for food and energy are known to be more volatile than other prices (especially energy). This can be seen in the GFC with a large spike in energy prices followed by a deflationary print. Currently, it is 1.75% higher than "core" consumer expenditures.

## Question 3: (d)

PCE Core implies: 8.5%, Including energy and food implies: 8.5%. This is far above the current fed funds rate of 2.56% (as of sep 2022).
