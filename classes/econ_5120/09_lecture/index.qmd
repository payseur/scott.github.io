## Chapter 14: GFC Short-Run

::: {style="font-size: 35px"}
-   **Financial frictions**: Despite fed funds rate going from 5% to \~0%, the interest rate at which households and firms could borrow was higher than before the crisis.

-   These financial frictions can be offset by lowering target rate, but there is a zero lower bound. Which led to **unconventional** monetary measures.

-   AS/AD suited for normal times, use IS/MP/PC for GFC.

-   Deflation: Holding the nominal interest rate **constant** $\implies$ deflation **raises** real interest rates. Can lead to a vicious cycle.

-   Faced with zero fed funds and deflation, the fed used unconventional policies: TARP, QE, and fiscal spending.

:::

::: {.column .incremental width="50%" style="font-size: 30px"}
-   In normal times the Fed effectively sets the real interest rate. This is the rate that households and firms borrow at.

-   Solvency and liquidity worries led to financial frictions.

-   The spread between government securities and the interest rate that firms and households pay increased.

-   10 year treasuries were \~6% below investment grade "medium" risk paper.

-   We incorporate this into our short-run model: $R=R^{ff}+\bar{f}$.

    -   $\bar{f}$ represents the exogenous risk premium that sits between the fed funds rate $R^{ff}$ and the real interest rate that firms borrow in financial markets.

    -   During normal times $\bar{f} =0$.

-   Leads to investment shock to the IS curve.

## GFC Shock to IS Curve

::: {style="font-size: 35px"}
-   **Financial frictions**: Fears over solvency and liquidity led to financial frictions.

-   This led to interest rate spikes and a stock market downturn, in addition to the housing market downturn.

-   Interest rates spiked resulting in a 30% decline in investment, $\bar{a}_i \downarrow$.

-   Stock and housing market declines reduced wealth and consumption leading to $\bar{a}_c \downarrow$.

## IS/MP Framework

:::

::: {.column .incremental width="50%" style="font-size: 30px"}
-   In normal times an negative aggregate demand shock will shift the IS curve down. (from IS to IS').

-   In response the central bank will lower the fed funds rate, $R^{ff}$, below the MPC, $\bar{r}$.

-   This will shift output back to potential, eliminating the recession.

-   During the GFC the Fed lowered the fed funds rate, which should have increase output.

-   Households and firms saw an interest rate of $R^{ff} + \bar{f}$ .

-   Despite the Fed's actions the economy saw an even deeper recession.

-   The fed lowered to zero, but still did not stimulate the economy.

-   Fed then took non conventional measures.

-   IS Curve: $\tilde{Y} = \bar{a} - \bar{b}(R_t - \bar{r})$

-   Monetary Policy Rule: $R_t^{ff}-\bar{r}=\bar{m}(\pi_t-\bar{\pi})$

-   Financial Friction: $R_t=R_t^{ff} + \bar{f}$

-   Combining financial friction with monetary policy: $R_t-\bar{r}=\bar{f}+\bar{m}(\pi_t-\bar{\pi})$

-   The new AD curve: $\tilde{Y}=\underbrace{\bar{a}-\bar{b}\bar{f}}_{AD\:shock}-\bar{b}\bar{m}(\pi_t - \bar{\pi})$

    -   Financial friction acts similar to an AD shock.

-   **Deflation**.

## Covid-19 Spreads

```
## Deflation

::: {style="font-size: 35px"}
-   Fisher equation: $i_t=R_t+\pi_t$

    -   Rearrange: $R_t = i_t -\pi_t$

    -   If $\pi < 0$ then real interest rate increases.

-   Central banks normally respond to $\bar{a}\downarrow$ by $i \downarrow$.

-   1930's Great Depression

    -   Fed did not lower $i$ because of fear of asset bubbles, deflation increase $R$ sharply.

    -   In 1933 the Fed lowered rates and economy turned around.
:::

## Deflation

::: {style="font-size: 35px"}
-   What if we have deflation coupled with a low nominal interest rate?

-   The Fed faces a zero lower bound on $i$.

    -   Imagine $i=0$, $R_t=-\pi_t$.
    -   Deflation $\implies R_t \uparrow$

-   Household and firms investment:

    -   If MPC is 1%, and inflation is 3%, investment.

    -   If MPC is 1% and inflation is -3%, no investment.
:::

## Deflation - Liquidity Trap

::: {style="font-size: 35px"}
-   Deflation coupled with a zero nominal interest rate causes a liquidity trap.

-   Firms and households do not want to borrow. Liquidity is trapped inside the banks and will not stimulate the economy.

-   Theoretically at this point currency and bonds are the same.

-   Other unconventional solutions:

    -   Japan has engaged in extensive open market operations for the past 20 years.

    -   Fed tripled balance sheet.

    -   Neither has had the recovery that was hoped for.
:::

## Deflationary Spiral

::: {style="font-size: 35px"}
-   Recession causes deflation.

-   Deflation raises $R$.

-   Recession deepens.

-   Causes more deflation.
:::

## Deflation Remedies

::: {style="font-size: 35px"}
-   Fiscal stimulus

-   Unconventional monetary policy

-   Manage $\pi^e$
:::

## Taylor Rule

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/figure_14_4a.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column .incremental width="50%" style="font-size: 30px"}
-   Taylor rule is more sophisticated thank the monetary policy rule from last chapter.

-   Short-run output level also influences the setting of the Fed Funds rate.

-   During crisis monetary policy appears to be expansionary (lying close or below the Taylor rule), however, financial frictions $\implies$ misleading.

-   Pre 2008 Fed Funds were kept low for too long + global savings glut.

:::

::: {.column .incremental width="50%" style="font-size: 30px"}
-   Pre 2008 Fed Funds were kept low for too long + global savings glut (house prices high).

    -   This had to do with the concern of deflation in 2001 and 2002.

-   Short-run output was negative until 2018 (lost generation).

    -   Or was it potential output?

:::

::: {.column .incremental width="50%" style="font-size: 30px"}
-   Taylor rule showed us that fed funds should be above zero since 2010.

    -   Does not account for financial frictions.

-   Taylor rule has to do with **short-run models** of the economy.

    -   Potential GDP estimates for 2007 vs latest.

    -   Closing of the output gap occurred primarily because potential GDP decreased, not actual GDP returning to its trend.

![](images/figure_14_5.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column .incremental width="50%" style="font-size: 25px"}
-   Recall that the CBO computes potential GDP based on an extended Solow model.

    -   Investment rates have been low following the financial crisis - this contributes to a lower potential GDP.

    -   We will also see that productivity rates has slowed considerably - also contributing to a lower potential GDP.

-   Did the GFC change firms' desire to make long term investments? How are short term and long term features of the economy held together?

-   Friedman: Great depression partly caused by deflation as a result of tight monetary policy.

    -   Money supply declined between 1929 and 1933.

    -   Bernanke in 2002 discussed Friedman's research saying "Your are right, we did it... but thanks to you we won't do it again.

-   In 2008 and 2009 there was rapid growth in money supply.

    -   Helped avoid deflation

    -   Targeted +2% $\bar{\pi}$ .

    -   Bernanke was true to his word.

-   Conventional monetary policy failed to stimulate the economy.

    -   Fed and treasury created new policies to provide liquidity and capital to financial institutions.

        -   Swap less liquid instruments for treasury securities.

        -   Providing liquidity to large govt sponsored mortgage companies: Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac.

        -   Direct capital injections through the TARP.

::: {.column .incremental width="50%" style="font-size: 25px"}
-   Currency was increased somewhat, but most of the liabilities were parked in reserves of financial institutions.

    -   For the most part the financial institutions kept the money in reserves instead of lending them out.

        -   Worried about financial risk (stress tests, Basel 2&3 capital requirements)

        -   Fed started paying interest on reserves.

        -   By adjusting the interest rate the Fed could control how much was lent out.

-   QE1 is largely credited for helping avoid depression.

-   Further QE actions had less impact (same as 1/4% cut in FF rate, 1.25% change in employment).

## TARP

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 35px"}
-   Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) passed by congress in the fall of 2008 established a fund to be used by the Treasury.

-   \$700B fund used to buy and insure assets from troubled financial institutions.

    -   Funds ultimately used to purchase equity in banks, guarantee loans to those institutions and even bail out US autos.

        -   97% was returned to treasury by 2012.
:::

## Fiscal Stimulus

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 35px"}
-   American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009

-   \$787B package designed to stimulate aggregate demand in the economy.

    -   \$250B in tax cuts

    -   \$500B in new govt spending on unemployment, infrastructure, education, health care, and aid to state and local govts.

    -   CBO estimates \$185B in 2009, \$400B in 2010.

    -   Deficit rose to 10% of GDP.
:::

## Financial Reform - Moral Hazard

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 35px"}
-   Financial institutions were able to use \$3 of their money and \$97 of borrowed money to purchase risky assets.

-   In 2008 MBS were the risky asset.

-   When the MBS market turned bad, these companies were deemed **too big to fail** and were bailed out.

-   What should happen? Bankruptcy. Equity holders lose everything and bond holders get a portion of the liquidated company.

-   2008 all big banks were in trouble. Lehman Brothers went bankrupt which led to panic.
:::

## Financial Reform

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 35px"}
-   Enhance capital requirements: typically around 7% if increased the stability of financial institution improves.

-   Systemic Regulator: Enforces financial reform.

-   Executive Compensation linked to Long-Term Performance: Claw-backs/deferred comp.

-   Require convertible debt: bonds could convert to equity if certain crisis conditions were met. Puts the risk on the owners of the firm.

-   Living wills - Some firms will fail, a plan for their assets and liabilities if that should happen.
:::

## Secular Stagnation

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 35px"}
-   2014 Larry Summers proposed that secular stagnation might have taken hold in western economies.

    -   Combination of slow economic growth, low inflation, and negative real interest rates.

    -   Global savings glut with a decline in demand for investment.

        -   Increased supply of saving and shift back in demand for investment could lead to negative equilibrium real interest rate.

        -   Low investment can lead to low capital accumulation in a Solow model leading to slow growth.

        -   Slow recovery!
:::

## Productivity Slowdown

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/figure_14_11.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column .incremental width="50%" style="font-size: 30px"}
-   Alternative or complementary explaination for the slow recovery is the level of TFP.
-   Since 2004 TFP has been low, averaging just:
    -   0.5% in the private business sector

    -   -0.3% in manufacturing
-   Businesses with great ideas in GFC were constrained by investment
-   R&D spending growth was higher before 2000 now it is flat.

## Conclusion

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 35px"}
-   The direct cost of bailing out financial institutions was only a small portion of overall costs.

-   The bulk of the costs were borne by people outside the finance industry

-   Main cost is measured in jobs lost and forgone GDP; inflicted around the world.

-   Financial reforms and lessons learned should help avoid another balance sheet crisis.
:::

## DSGE Models

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   DSGE Models- Dynamic Stochastic Generalized Equilibrium Models

-   Frontier of macro-economic fluctuations (shocks and their effects).

-   First DSGE models were real business cycle models, such as modified Solow models. Demonstrated that TFP shocks could lead to business cycle like fluctuations

-   Labor market block of the models shows immediate impact of shocks.

-   Permanent income hypothesis holding provides a good bridge to consumption dynamics.

-   Sticky vs flexible prices lead to different conclusions and DSGE models.

-   Estimating models is beyond this class but DSGE models can show similar dynamics as AS/AD models. With more detail.
:::

## DSGE Motivation

::: {style="font-size: 30px"}
Economists have long been puzzled by the observations that during peacetime industrial market economies display **recurrent**, large **fluctuations** in output and employment over relatively short time periods. . . . These observations should **not be** puzzling, for they are what **standard economic theory predicts**. For the United States, in fact, given people's ability and willingness to **intertemporally and intratemporally substitute consumption and leisure** and given the nature of the **changing production possibility set**, it would be puzzling if the economy did not display these large fluctuations in output and employment.

-Edward C. Prescott

-   (D)SGE - Dynamic: evolution of macro-economy over time.

-   D(S)GE - Stochastic: Shocks to the economy lead to macro-economic fluctuations.

-   DS(GE) - General Equilibrium: models feature labor and asset markets that determine every price in the economy everyday.

## Real Business Cycles to DSGE

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   RBC models led to an explosion of additional research as economists sought to enrich models to include shocks and explain further variables.

-   Modern DSGE models are divided into three categories:

    -   Endogenous Variables

    -   Shocks

    -   Mechanics of economy that affect the way shocks impact endogenous variables over time.
:::

## Endogenous Variables

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   Familiar already:

    -   GDP

    -   Consumption

    -   Investment

    -   Government Spending

    -   Employment

    -   Capital

    -   Wages

    -   Interest rates

    -   Inflation

-   Labor Market particularly important. output = f(hours, effort)
:::

## Shocks

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   Exogenous variables move over time because the economy is hit by shocks

-   Timing:

    -   Some are temporary and some are permanent.

    -   Some happen now and some we know will happen in the future.

-   Types:

    -   TFP, government purchases, taxes, monetary policy, energy prices, financial frictions, price markups above marginal cost

-   Uncertainty:

    -   Around all shocks there is a level of uncertainty, statistically captured by a distribution over time. (not always symmetrical.)
:::

## Features of DSGE Models

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   **Nominal rigitidies:** In order for monetary policy to have real effects on the economy some friction must interfere with price adjustment.

    -   Sticky wages and sticky prices

-   **Adjustment costs:** in Solow transition dynamics the first period after a shock included the largest move back towards steady-state. Milton Friedman said monetary policy had peak effect after *long and variable lags*.

-   **Heterogeneity:** People and firms are not the same, different reservation wages, elasticities, etc.

-   **Complete vs Incomplete markets:** Market is segmented by time and geography.
:::

## Mathematics of DSGE Models

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   Solow model: savings rate is assumed constant (and exogenous).

-   DSGE Model: people make decisions about saving each period.

-   Consider a quarterly model of the past 50 years (200 quarters), a decision one period may affect the decision in a later period.

-   Savings today becomes investment, which becomes capital tomorrow, which affects wage rates tomorrow, which affects how much people want to work and consume tomorrow.

-   Even relatively simple models hard to solve.
:::

## A Stylized Approach to DSGE: Labor

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/figure_15_2.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column .incremental width="50%" style="font-size: 25px"}
-   Most DSGE Models feature at least Labor, Capital and Output markets.
-   Labor Demand Curve:
    -   Reflects the profit-maximizing of firms in deciding how much labor to hire.

    -   Firms continue expanding employment until the marginal product of labor equals real wage (MPL = w)

    -   $Y=\bar{A}K^{1/3}L^{2/3}$ Labor has decreasing returns to scale.

    -   Partial derivative, set equal to w, $w=\frac{2}{3}\frac{\bar{A}K^{2/3}}{L^{1/3}}$

-   Equilibrium in the labor market:
    -   Point where labor supply equals labor demand pins down

        -   the real wage that clears the labor market

        -   the amount of labor that gets used in production

        -   Simplification, we assume $\bar{c}$ , hard to solve for forward looking consumption.

## A Stylized Approach to DSGE: TFP Shock

-   Use DSGE framework to study a temporary negative TFP shock.
-   TFP is low $\implies$ not a good time to produce, labor demand shifts down.
-   When $\bar{A}$ is lower the output that an extra worker will produce declines $\implies MPL \downarrow$
-   Equilibrium in the labor market goes from point A to point B. Employment falls and wages fall. This looks very much like a recession.
-   Note: temporary implies little effect on consumption.

## A Stylized Approach to DSGE: Increased Taxes

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.column .incremental width="50%" style="font-size: 25px"}
-   Use DSGE framework to study a temporary rise in tax paid by firms from zero to $\tau$ .
-   Since this tax is paid by firms the marginal product of capital changes and the labor demand curve becomes: $w=(1-\tau)\frac{2}{3}\frac{\bar{A}K^{2/3}}{L^{1/3}}$
-   TFP is low $\implies$ not a good time to produce, labor demand shifts down.
-   Equilibrium in the labor market goes from point A to point B. Employment falls and wages fall. This looks very much like a recession.
-   Note: temporary implies little effect on consumption.

## DSGE: Rise in Government Purchases

::: columns

-   Suppose that their is a military build up that will be financed by lump sum of taxes at an unspecified date.
-   Use DSGE framework to study effects of this shock.
-   Consumption: permanent income hypothesis
    -   Must pay for this in the future so consumption is lowered.

    -   If permanent than increase in G is equal to decrease in C.

    -   If temporary than increase in G is greater than decrease in C.
-   More generally consumption is the variable in DSGE models that accounts for the future.
-   Shift from A to B not like a typical recession, lower wages, lower consumption, higher labor supplied.
