Typically, this risk\naffects fixed-income investments such as bonds, where the value of the\nbond can fluctuate in response to changes in prevailing interest rates.\nWhen interest rates rise, the value of existing bonds decreases, as the\ninterest rate being paid by the bond is now lower than the prevailing\ninterest rate. Conversely, if interest rates fall, the value of existing\nbonds increases. To put it differently, the value of a bond is\nnegatively correlated with the current interest rates.This is a post with executable code.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
